<h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
<ol>

<li>  2 cups of dried pasta – I used penne</li>

                    <li>	1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
                            <li>1 cup chopped red onion</li>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
1.	Chop tomatoes into a medium dice. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and half 
of the minced basil to the diced tomatoes. Stir to combine and let
 it sit as you prep the other ingredients and bring the water to a boil.
2.	Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add pasta and bouillon.
 Cook pasta according to package instructions.
3.	While the pasta is cooking, heat a large sauté pan over medium high heat. 
Add the olive oil to the pan. Next add the minced garlic and 
stir the garlic to cook for 30 seconds. Don’t let it burn.
4.	Using a fine mesh sieve, strain the tomatoes over the sauté pan,
 so the tomato juice flows directly into the sauté pan. 
 You want to add all the tomato juice to the garlic cooking in the sauté pan.
  Set the tomatoes aside and cook the tomato juice over medium high heat for a minute or
   two until the tomato juice thickens slightly.
5.	Drain the pasta when ready and set to the side.
6.	Add the 3 tbs of butter to the tomato juice/garlic mixture in the sauté pan. 
Stir or swirl pan as the butter melts so it is fully blended into the sauce.
7.	Once all the butter has melted, turn off the heat and add the cooked pasta 
to the sauce in the sauté pan. Toss to combine.
8.	Next, add the tomatoes and black pepper to the pan and toss.
9.	Transfer pasta to a bowl. Add the remaining basil and diced mozzarella and stir to combine.
